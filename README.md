# Network and System Metrics Scripts

This repository is a collection of Bash scripts focused on Linux network performance testing, system metrics, and tuning. These scripts have been useful in real-world environments for benchmarking and evaluating NIC cards, investigating, analyzing, and testing networking behavior, IRQ/XPS/aRFS settings, softirqs, and system utilization.

Feel free to use, modify, or contribute â€” no obligations. Iâ€™ll keep improving these as time permits.

## ðŸš§ TODOs

- Currently, scripts rely on fixed argument ordering.
- `getopts` is not implemented yet for flexible CLI options.

## ðŸš€ Notes on Script Customization

While most of the 21 scripts included should work out of the box, a few may require minor modifications depending on your specific test setup. These scripts were tested on a 144-core system with processes pinned to CPUs 0â€“71. This setup allowed for measurement of packet processing on expected cores (0â€“71) versus unexpected cores (72â€“143).

The following scripts may require changes:

1. compare.sh â€“ Assumes tests are run on CPUs 0â€“71. If your test setup differs, update the CPU ranges (0â€“71 and 72â€“143) accordingly. If you're not interested in distinguishing unexpected cores, you may simplify by analyzing all queues without filtering.

2. drops.sh and pkts.sh â€“ These rely on standardized metrics from modern ethtool output and typically should not require any changes.

3. netperf_test.sh â€“ If you do not want to pin test processes to a specific set of CPUs, uncomment the lcpus=72 line.

4. parse_all_files.sh â€“ Contains lines referencing CPU ranges (0â€“71 / 72â€“143). If you're running tests across all cores, you can remove or modify those filters.

5. run_all_tests.sh â€“ This is the main driver script. Set the appropriate values for CONN, RPS, and other parameters as required for your tests.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Test Suite

1. The main entry point is `run_all_tests.sh`. You can modify this script as needed.
2. Run it as follows:
   ./run_all_tests.sh <IP> {Time} {Device} &

    Examples:
	nohup ./run_all_tests.sh 10.65.36.80 &
	nohup ./run_all_tests.sh 10.65.36.80 180 ens3f0 &
3. Output files will be generated under the Results/ directory.

---

## ðŸš€ How to analyze the test results

1. After a test run, move the results to a new directory:
	- mkdir Results/org
	- mv Results/*.out Results/org
2. If a second run was done, store those separately:
	- mkdir Results/new
	- mv Results/*.out Results/new
3. Parse the first run:
	(cd Results/org; ./parse_all_files.sh > /tmp/org)
4. Optionally, parse and compare a second run:
	(cd Results/new; ./parse_all_files.sh > /tmp/new)
	./compare.sh /tmp/org /tmp/new
